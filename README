Current version: 1.0 -- February 3, 2011

-----
Theory:
-----
See Chapter 4 of:

Danny Calegari, scl, MSJ Memoirs 20. Mathematical Society of Japan, Tokyo, 2009


-----
Installation:
-----
Just type "make".  You will need gmp, gtk, gtkglext, and opengl.  If you're using
linux or fink, you can probably just install the packages for these things
using the default settings, and everything should work.

------
Usage:
------
Try the following:
Note there are some chains provided by default
 - press "run"
 - after a few seconds, press "pause"
 - press "step" a bunch of times
 - enter something like "0.2" in the tolerance box
 - press "run" and wait for it to finish
 - delete the tolerance and press "run" again

Because scabble uses the same strategy to compute scl as scallop, the same 
comments on rigor are appropriate (and the same fix applicable):

------
Rigour:
------

The algorithm that scallop uses to compute scl is rigorous
for (finite linear combinations of) (cyclically) *alternating words*:
those where a generator never appears twice (or more) in a row. 
Hence: abAB is alternating, aaab is not, a is not.

For nonalternating input, scallop rigorously computes upper
bounds on scl. Moreover, the output is "statistically" correct
on *most* input, especially if the value of scl is small.
